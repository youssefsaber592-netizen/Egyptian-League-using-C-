 Egyptian League Management System (C++ & Data Structures)

A console-based Egyptian League Management System built using C++ that simulates the structure and workflow of the Egyptian Premier League while applying core Data Structures concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

This project manages teams, players, matches, standings, and statistics, demonstrating how data structures can efficiently organize and process sports league data.

 Features

Add / remove teams and players

Schedule and manage matches

Update match results automatically

Calculate and display league standings

Track team statistics (points, goals, wins, losses)

Search and sort teams and players

Menu-driven interactive console UI

Data Structures Used

Linked List – for managing teams and players

Stack & Queue – for match scheduling and history

Arrays / Vectors – for storing match data

Sorting Algorithms – for ranking teams

Searching Algorithms – for quick data retrieval

Objective

To apply Data Structures concepts in a practical system that mimics a real football league, improving understanding of how these structures work in real applications.
